# /HandBrake_Scripts
---
## Purpose
Bash scripts to run handbrake on all files in current directory and all sub-directories.

## Git Repo Info
As of 01-30-2018 the current main script is:

    /HandBrake_Scripts/HB_DashCam_Converter-Production.sh

By main script I mean the script that needs to be ran first that will do the error code detection the checking to make 
sure all the files and directories are in the correct places and will execute all the other scripts that preform the specific actions if they are required and so on and so on....

## Misc Info
All the other files are either support files (which you will know if they are because they will be in the main script executed) or they are test scripts I used when working out how to first engineer this script.
